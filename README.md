## My process

I checked the style guide file and took note of the widths and font sizes listed there. I then saw that was the text was displayed on the DOM was not different from screen size to screen size. Using that as a starting point, I did my best to eyeball the sizes of everything else.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- PostCSS

### What I learned

I learned that I need to remember to give a container element a height if I want to vertically center elements in it.
